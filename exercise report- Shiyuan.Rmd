## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


# Load the necessary R packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(knitr)

## Read the data (assuming the file name is ‘data.csv’ and the table headers from row 4 onwards)
data <- read_csv("1249534s1.csv", skip = 3)

# Standardise column names to avoid errors caused by spaces or special characters
colnames(data) <- make.names(colnames(data))

# Check
colnames(data)

# Select the relevant columns and make sure the column names are correct
data_selected <- data %>%
  select(Experiment, ambient.CO2...6, increased.CO2...7) %>%
  na.omit()

# calculate (Log Response Ratio, LRR)
data_selected <- data_selected %>%
  mutate(LRR = log(`increased.CO2...7` / `ambient.CO2...6`))

# Display of results in tabular form
kable(data_selected, caption = "对数响应比率 (LRR) 计算结果")


summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
